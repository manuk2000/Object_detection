Mini README File

This program consists of multiple Python scripts that work together 
to achieve a specific functionality. Here's a brief overview of
each script and their purpose:

1: background_version.py: This script is responsible for processing 
a video by applying a zoom effect to specific regions based on 
user-defined parameters. It utilizes the functions and logic from 
other scripts to accomplish the zooming functionality.

2: tracking/ReduceArr.py: This script contains functions to track 
the position of an object in a video and generate a reduced array 
that represents the object's movement over time. The reduced array 
is used in later stages of the program to determine the zoom timing.

3: zoom/ZoomBarrier.py: This script enables the user to select the 
positions of barrier dots in the video, which are used as reference 
points for determining the left and right zoom positions.

4: zoom/times_left_right_zoom.py: This script calculates the zoom 
timing by analyzing the reduced array generated by the tracking process. 
It determines when to switch between the left and right zoom positions 
based on the barrier dot positions.

5: zoom/result.py: This script combines all the components together 
to achieve the final result. It reads the necessary input files, 
performs the zooming process using the determined positions and timing, 
and generates the processed video with the applied zoom effect.

To see the result of the program, you can run the result.py file.
This script will execute the entire program and generate the processed 
video with the applied zoom effect. Running the result.py file will provide 
you with the visual outcome of the zooming process on the input video.
